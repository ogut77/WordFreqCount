We created Apache Spark application at Google Colab Environment. This application is a basic example of Apache Spark. It downloads a document from Internet (In our cases, it is a Shakespare's play), parse the words  and counts word numbers and most frequent words for this document. You can do this application at Google Colab without paying for computing power or installing any softwares at your desktop.
Computing power is very fast as well compared to desktop application of Apache Spark
